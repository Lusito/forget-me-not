        "message": "# Introduction Tutorial\n\n## Firefox settings\nPlease note, that this extension has no access to your Firefox settings, so any cookie settings you make in Firefox itself will be combined with this extension.\n\nSo if you configure Firefox to deny all cookies, this extension will have no cookies to work with.\n\n## White, gray and red lists\nDomain names (host names of a website, like *google.com*) can be added to color-coded lists (like whitelists)\n- **White**: Cookies and local storage will never be removed.\n- **Gray**: Cookies and local storage will be removed upon browser restart (must be enabled in the settings).\n- **Red**: Gray and white rules can be overridden by a red rule.\n  - Example: A white rule allows all domains (\"\\*\" as expression) and a couple of red rules define exceptions to that rule.\n- **Black**: Prevent cookies from ever being set\n  - Any rule will be overriden by a black rule.\n  - Sadly, cookies set from JavaScript can't be blocked, but will be removed almost instantly after creation.\n\n## Valid expressions\n- Every hostname (e.g. www.google.com) is a valid expression.\n- An asterisk (*) can be used as placeholder for a segment (e.g. *.google.com or www.\\*.com).\n- Whitelists currently overrule graylists.. not sure if this is final.\n\n### Cookie specific expressions\nYou can create rules for cookiename and domain combinations.\n- Example: `cookiename@*.google.com`\n- `cookiename` can be any valid cookie name.\n- The same rules, as seen above, apply for the domain specific part to the right of the `@` sign.\n- Cookie specific rules are always preferred over normal rules.\n\n## Third party cookies\n- When a cookie is set without belonging to a domain which is open in a tab, it is considered a thirdparty cookie.\n- Research is being done to improve this method.\n\n## Snooze Mode\n\nOn the popup-tab \"Snooze Mode\", you can temporarily disable automatic cleanup. See The tab for instructions.\n\n## Types of Cleanup\n\nYou can choose which data to cleanup:\n- **Cookies**: Normal HTTP cookies. Flash cookies are covered by \"Plugin Data\".\n- **Local Storage** and **Indexed DB**: Websites can store data on your browser to allow certain features or to remember something for the next visit.\nSometimes Firefox refers to *Indexed DB* as \"Storage\", so if Firefox tells you, that youtube.com uses some MB of Storage, it is probably *Indexed DB*.\n- **History**: This contains all your website visits.\n- **Downloads**: This contains the history of downloads. Cleaning downloads does not remove the files on your disk.\n- **Form Data**: At some point you might have entered information in for example a contact or billing form. Depending on your settings, this might have been saved, so it's easier for you to re-enter these values.\n- **Passwords**: You might have told Firefox to remember certain passwords. Choose this to remove them again.\n- **Plugin Data**: Plugins (not add-ons/web-extensions) like Adobe Flash or Acrobat Reader might store data like Flash cookies or other information & settings.\n- **Service Workers**: Service Workers are a way to allow Websites to be used offline and also help to speed up loading web-apps that make use of this.\n- **Server Bound Certificates**: If you added certificates to allow connections to a server, then this is the option to clear it with."

    "experimental_page": {
        "message": "## Experimental Features\n\n- From time to time there will be new features which are marked as experimental.\n- They will be disabled by default and need to be manually enabled.\n- These features are used to evaluate new ways to improve the extension.\n- They might be instable or have bad performance.\n- If you experience issues, try turning these features off.\n- Please submit feedback and bug reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lusito/forget-me-not/issues)\n\n## Currently active experiments:\n- **Purge Expired Cookies**:\nWhenever a cleanup happens, cookies that have an expiration date set in the past will be removed regardless of the configured rules. Normally Firefox only deletes expired cookies when a certain limit is hit. Those cookies would not get send to the website, but they would still be there. This option will help removing these ghosting cookies.\n- **Deny Thirdparty Cookies**:  \nIf enabled, every web request will be intercepted to remove cookies from domains which don't belong to the tabs URL and are not protected by a rule. So these cookies will never be set.\n\nPlease give me feedback on your experience with these experiments, so I can decide whether or not to add them permanently."
